## Introduction

The Recipes project is a recipe search system designed to provide users with access to a diverse database of recipes. Users can view recipe details, preparation instructions, and even save their favorite family recipes.

- Create a personal area for logged-in users where they can manage favorite recipes, personal recipes, and family recipes.
- Develop an About page to provide information about the development team and the project's goals.
- Design a registration page with specific validation rules for user registration.
- Enable users to log in and access their personal area.
